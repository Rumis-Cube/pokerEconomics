# Engines

The following types of engines are available for different purposes.

1. `engine.py` - Primary engine to run simulations.
2. `mult_engine.py` - A variant of `engine.py` to run multiple simulations with multi-threading.
3. `benchmark.py` - Engine to determine the performance of the workstation to handle the engines.
4. `Test.py` - Engine to test `Game.py`.

In addition, there's an `utils.py` which contains all the helper functions for the engines.
