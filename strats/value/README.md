# Value based Strategies

These strategies take actions based on hand strength and other value based calculation.

They can be broken down into the following categories.

1. `private`: Takes action solely on the basis of private value.
2. `public`: Takes action solely on the basis of public value.
3. `mixed`: Takes action on the basis of both private and public value.
4. `sentient`: Takes strategic actions inspired from how an intelligent being would/can play. Based on the Master thesis.
